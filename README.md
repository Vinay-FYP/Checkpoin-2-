# Checkpoint-2-
Charts, Dashboard, maps, dialog


After finally completing the login and registration situation I needed to create my home screen for a user who is signed in. 
I wanted to implement a dashboard style homepage so i followed some youtube tutuorials for this one. I learned how to implement a dashboard using differetn types of layouts layered on top of one another implmenting  a cardview to create the tile repesentation of an option for the user to select. I also learned hw to import a circular image from online.

Using charts in a big part of my functionality for the application. I needed to lear how to implement charts. I managed to implement bar charts, pie charts and radar charts, however I want to just use bar charts for the sake of simplicity. I also managed to animate them. i want be able to create btter looking graphs if i can before the final submission.

I forgot how to use Dialogs so I needed to recap on this in order to display messages to a user who enters their values for the footrpint calculator. 
Youtube was whee I plan to go for this info and refailiarisemyself  with the dialog builder in android studio. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ARezg1D9Zd0

Maps and APis in general are what i need to carry over into checkpoint 3. i struggled implementing google maps in order for a user to plot points for a flight journey and for the journey planner feature. I still can't seem to get it right but hopefully can make a breakthrough from youtube tutorials and other material online.
